# 1live-playlist-creator
An application for creating playlists from the German radio station 1LIVE

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a proof-of-concept
- [x] Create a GCP/Firebase project and translate POC into a working app (gather data as other parts get finished)
- [x] Add logic to interface with the Spotify API and create pre-made playlists on my personal account
- [ ] Add a webapp (most likely React/Next.js) to give users more insights on the playlists (show gathered data)
- [x] Add a job for filling up the backlog *(already done by hand)*
- [ ] Expand to other 1LIVE plalists (Neu f√ºr den Sektor, DIGGI) *(added NfdS)*
